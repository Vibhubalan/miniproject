# Sentiment Analysis in Python 
(DATASET WON'T BE SHARED SINCE ITS A DATASET OF MY COLLEGE REVIEWS WHICH I HAVE GOT USING WEBSCRAPING)

In this notebook, we will be doing some sentiment analysis in Python using two different techniques:

1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** - Bag of words approach
2. **RoBERTa Pretrained Model from 🤗 Huggingface**

## Implementation Environment

### Data Handling
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Used for numerical operations.

### Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting graphs and visualizing data.
- **Seaborn**: Used for creating statistical graphics.
- **Style**: Using 'ggplot' for consistent and appealing visualizations.

### Sentiment Analysis
- **NLTK**: Used for natural language processing tasks.
- **VADER**: Used for sentiment analysis using the VADER lexicon.
- **Huggingface Pipeline**: Used for sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa pretrained model.

## New Section

### Data Preparation
- **Load Data**: Importing the dataset from a CSV file (`/scem-df.csv`).

### Sentiment Analysis Techniques
- **VADER**: Analyzing sentiment using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner.
- **RoBERTa**: Leveraging the pretrained RoBERTa model from Huggingface for sentiment analysis.
